Plannier
A Flutter event planning app built as part of my Bachelor Thesis at Babeș-Bolyai University.

Plannier helps users manage events by creating to-do lists, sending invitations, and preserving memories through image-to-video conversion. The project includes a custom Flutter plugin developed in Kotlin and Swift that enables native video encoding on both Android and iOS platforms.
